# Story 4.2: Haversine Distance Calculation

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** system,
**I want** Haversine distance calculation for initial filtering,
**so that** I can quickly filter contractors by approximate distance before expensive API calls.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Haversine Implementation:** Haversine formula implemented
2. **Distance Calculation:** Calculate great-circle distance between two points
3. **Performance:** Fast calculation for bulk filtering
4. **Accuracy:** Sufficient accuracy for initial filtering
5. **Coarse Filtering:** Used for initial candidate filtering
6. **Integration:** Integrated with recommendations flow
7. **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests
8. **Documentation:** Haversine usage documented
9. **Fallback:** Can be used as fallback if ORS unavailable
10. **Optimization:** Optimized for performance

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement Haversine formula
  - [ ] Create `HaversineCalculator` class
  - [ ] Implement distance calculation
  - [ ] Return distance in meters
- [ ] Add performance optimization
  - [ ] Optimize calculation for speed
  - [ ] Consider using approximate formulas if needed
- [ ] Integrate with recommendations
  - [ ] Use for initial contractor filtering
  - [ ] Filter by maximum distance threshold
  - [ ] Pass filtered candidates to ORS
- [ ] Create unit tests
  - [ ] Test distance calculation accuracy
  - [ ] Test edge cases (same point, antipodal points)
  - [ ] Test performance
- [ ] Add fallback support
  - [ ] Use Haversine if ORS unavailable
  - [ ] Log fallback usage
- [ ] Document usage
  - [ ] Document when Haversine is used
  - [ ] Document accuracy limitations

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- Haversine calculator: `src/SmartScheduler.Domain/Scheduling/Utilities/HaversineCalculator.cs`

### Architecture References
- **Coarse-to-Refine:** See `docs/prd/caching-performance.md`
- **Strategy:** Haversine for initial filtering, ORS for top candidates - see PRD
- **Performance:** Fast calculation for bulk filtering - see architecture

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** `src/SmartScheduler.Domain.Tests/`
- **Calculation Tests:** Test distance accuracy
- **Performance Tests:** Verify fast calculation

### UI Integration Notes
- Haversine not directly used in UI
- Results affect which contractors appear in recommendations
- Final distance shown uses ORS (more accurate)
