# Story 6.1: Recommendations API Backend

## Status
Approved

## Story

**As a** dispatcher,
**I want** to request contractor recommendations for a job via API,
**so that** I can see ranked contractors with suggested time slots.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **POST /recommendations:** Endpoint accepts jobId and desiredDate, returns ranked recommendations
2. **Ranking Algorithm:** Contractors ranked by weighted score (availability, rating, distance, rotation)
3. **Time Slots:** Up to 3 suggested time slots per contractor (earliest, lowest-travel, highest-confidence)
4. **Performance:** p95 latency < 500ms under baseline load
5. **Audit Trail:** Full audit record persisted (request payload, candidates, scores, config version)
6. **Score Breakdown:** Each recommendation includes per-factor scores and rationale
7. **Coarse-to-Refine:** Uses Haversine for initial filtering, OpenRouteService for top candidates
8. **Caching:** Distance/ETA results cached to improve performance
9. **Error Handling:** Proper error responses for invalid requests
10. **OpenAPI Documentation:** Endpoint fully documented

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- API endpoint: `src/SmartScheduler.Api/Endpoints/Recommendations/`
- Query handler: `src/SmartScheduler.Application/Recommendations/Queries/`
- Scoring service: `src/SmartScheduler.Application/Recommendations/Services/ScoringService.cs`
- Audit entity: `src/SmartScheduler.Domain/Recommendations/Entities/AuditRecommendation.cs`

### Architecture References
- **API Specification:** See `docs/architecture/api-specification.md` for `/recommendations` endpoint
- **Scoring Algorithm:** See `docs/prd/epic-5-scoring-ranking-v1-rules.md`
- **Performance:** p95 < 500ms requirement - see `docs/prd/7-non-functional-requirements.md`
- **Coarse-to-Refine:** See `docs/prd/caching-performance.md`

### Testing Standards
- **Test Location:** `src/SmartScheduler.Api.Tests/` and `src/SmartScheduler.Application.Tests/`
- **API Tests:** Integration tests for endpoint, performance tests
- **Scoring Tests:** Unit tests for scoring algorithm, deterministic scores
- **Performance Tests:** Load tests to verify p95 < 500ms

### UI Integration Notes
- Frontend has `RecommendationsSheet` component (see `frontend/components/jobs/recommendations-sheet.tsx`)
- Frontend currently uses mock data with `generateRecommendations` function
- Frontend expects recommendations with score breakdown and time slots
- UI is 95% complete - needs API integration
