  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient LINQ-based ordering. O(n log n) complexity is acceptable for typical candidate sets. No performance concerns."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Edge cases handled: empty candidates, single candidate, null travel times, no slots. Deterministic ordering verified."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear, readable implementation. Tie-breaker order is explicit and well-documented. Easy to modify if needed."
