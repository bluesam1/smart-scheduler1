    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "N+1 query pattern in utilization calculation could impact performance. No performance tests to verify p95 < 500ms target."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Error handling present, caching reduces load. Graceful degradation if calculations fail."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean architecture, well-structured code, good separation of concerns. Comments explain complex calculations."
