  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Simple calculation with O(1) complexity. No performance impact."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Edge cases handled: invalid utilization values clamped. Null return when disabled or above threshold is appropriate."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clear linear decay formula. Well-documented. Easy to adjust boost amount or threshold via config."
