nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No security concerns. Scoring is internal calculation only."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Efficient O(n) scoring calculation. No external dependencies in hot path. Exponential decay formula is computationally efficient."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Edge cases handled: negative distance, zero distance, very long distance, no slots. Deterministic behavior ensures consistent results."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Well-structured service with clear separation of concerns. Good documentation. Normalization logic is clear and maintainable."
