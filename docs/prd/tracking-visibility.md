# Tracking & Visibility

* **Definition of Done (per epic):** Working vertical slice in prod‑like env, automated tests passing, dashboards updated, and a short Loom‑style demo.
* **Progress view:** Kanban lanes by epic with % complete; weekly burn‑up by count of passing E2E scenarios.
* **Test artifacts:** For each epic, store fixtures and golden files to guarantee determinism.
