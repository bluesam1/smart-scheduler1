# Epic 3 — Availability Engine v1 (Hours + Buffers)

**Scope:** Compute feasible slots per contractor from hours, existing jobs, and **Travel Buffer Policy**. **Demo:** Given one contractor and two jobs, UI shows feasible/blocked windows changing as jobs are added. **Tests:** Deterministic slot calculations; edge cases (breaks, blackout); property‑based tests for overlaps. **Telemetry:** Slot computation time; late‑arrival simulation checks.
