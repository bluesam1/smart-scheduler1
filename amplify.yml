# Note: Amplify should automatically serve static files if they exist
# The rewrite rule below should only apply when files don't exist
# However, if static assets are being served as HTML, the rewrite is too aggressive
# Try removing redirects entirely first - Next.js client-side routing may work without it
# If direct URL access doesn't work, we'll need to add the rewrite back with exclusions
# redirects:
#   - source: '/<*>'
#     target: '/index.html'
#     status: '200'
