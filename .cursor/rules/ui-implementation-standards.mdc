`docs/ui-implementation-spec.md`

## When This Rule Applies

This rule applies to:
- All UI component development
- All frontend implementation tasks
- All user story creation that involves UI/frontend work
- All design system implementations
- All accessibility implementations
- All responsive design work

## Key Requirements

### 1. Design System Compliance

All UI components MUST use:
- **Color Palette:** As defined in Section 2.1 of the UI spec

- **Shadows:** As defined in Section 2.5

### 2. Component Library

- **Primary Library:** shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI + Tailwind CSS)
- All components must use shadcn/ui base components when available
- Custom components must follow the design system specifications

### 3. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **React:** 18+
- **TypeScript:** 5.x
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **Component Library:** shadcn/ui

### 4. Accessibility Requirements

- **WCAG 2.1 AA compliance:** Minimum standard for all components

### 6. File Structure

All UI code must follow the file structure defined in Section 12.2:
```
ui/web/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router
├── components/             # React components
│   ├── ui/                # shadcn/ui components
│   ├── layout/            # Layout components
│   ├── jobs/              # Feature components
│   └── shared/            # Shared components
├── lib/                   # Utilities
├── types/                 # TypeScript types
└── styles/                # Global styles
```

## Story Creation Requirements

When creating user stories that involve UI work:

1. **Reference the UI spec:** Include a note in the story referencing `docs/ui-implementation-spec.md`
2. **Specify components:** Use component names from Section 11 (Component Specifications)
3. **Include accessibility:** Always include accessibility acceptance criteria (AC: 10 in existing stories)
4. **Include responsive design:** Always include responsive design acceptance criteria (AC: 11 in existing stories)

## Implementation Checklist

Before marking any UI task as complete, verify:
- [ ] Colors match the UI spec palette (Section 2.1)
- [ ] Typography follows the type scale (Section 2.2)
- [ ] Spacing uses the 4px base unit system (Section 2.3)
- [ ] Components use shadcn/ui when available (Section 2.6)
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (Section 8)
- [ ] Responsive design implemented (Section 7)
- [ ] File structure follows Section 12.2
- [ ] Component structure follows Section 12.3

## Enforcement

- **PM Agent:** Must reference UI spec when creating UI-related stories
- **Dev Agent:** Must verify UI spec compliance before completing UI tasks
- **QA Agent:** Must test against UI spec requirements
- **UX Expert Agent:** Must ensure designs align with UI spec

## Updates
